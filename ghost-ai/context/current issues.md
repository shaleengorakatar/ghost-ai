## Issues

### 1. Save button in Workspace Navbar

Read the navbar component and the autosave hook before implementing.

The workspace navbar is missing a Save button. The autosave hook already exists and tracks saving/saved/error states - wire the button to it.

Add the Save button to the workspace navbar only. The navbar is shared with editor home so conditionally render the button based on workspace context - it must not appear on the editor home navbar.

Button behaviour:

- default state: shows "Save"
- while saving: shows "Saving..."
- after succesful save: shows "Saved" briefly then returns to "Save"
- on error: shows "Error" briefly then returns to "Save"
- clicking it triggers a manual save through the same save function the autosave hook uses

Also fix the canvas save API route. Open the route file at 'app/api/projects/[projectId]/canvas/route.ts' and make these two changes.

- in the PUT handler change 'access: "public"' to 'access: "private" in the Vercel Blob put call
- in the GET handler replace any raw fetch call with the Vercel Blob SDK to retrieve the blob content using the stored URL.

Do not change anything else.

### 2. Delete Nodes and Edges

Read Liveblocks agent skills before implementing this.
Then read canvas wrapper component and the existing node and edge mutation helpers.

Selected nodes and edges cannot be deleted from the canvas.
