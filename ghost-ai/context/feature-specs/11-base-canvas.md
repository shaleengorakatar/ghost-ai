Replace the canvas placeholder with a Liveblocks-backed React FLow canvas.

## Implementation 

1. Keep the workspace page server-side.

2. Create a client-side editor/canvas wrapper that sets up the Liveblocks room.

    It should include:
    - 'LiveblocksProvider' using '/api/liveblocks-auth'
    - 'RoomProvider' using the current room ID
    - initial presence with 'cursor: null'
    - 'ClientSideSuspense' with a simple loading state
    - an error fallback for Liveblocks connection issues

3. Wire React Flow to Liveblocks state.
    - use 'useLiveblocksFlow'
    - enable suspense
    - start with empty nodes and edges
    - pass the synched nodes, edges, and change handlers into 'ReactFlow'

4. Add shared canvas types in 'types/canvas.ts'.

    Node data should support:
    - label
    - color
    - shape

    Also define the custom node and edge types:
    - 'canvasNode'
    - 'canvasEdge'

5. Render the basic canvas.

    Include:
    - loose connection behaviour
    - 'fitView'
    - 'MiniMap'
    - dot-pattern background

## Scope Limits

- don't add controls yet
- don't add custom node or edge rendering yet
- don't add persistance logic
- don't add AI behaviour
- keep this focused on the collaborative canvas foundation

## Check when done

- Client canvas wrapper sets up the liveblocks room.
- React Flow uses Liveblocks-synced nodes and edges.
- Shared canvas types exist in 'types/canvas.ts'
- 'npm run build' passes
